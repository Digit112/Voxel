# Voxel

Attempt at a game engine.

The purpose of this project is not to create a useful product but simply to challenge myself and to learn more. To that end, I have limited myself to only using the C standard library plus the Xlib headers (necessary to create a window and draw graphics on most Unix systems) and OpenCL, which is used to run code on GPUs.

I achieved the goal of making a simple but relatively fun and only mildly glitchy game with it, as you can see here:

The project is on hiatus. When I get back around to it I'll add proper textures.
